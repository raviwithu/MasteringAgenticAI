# 🛡️ AI Threat Modeling Assistant

An AI-native Streamlit app that turns a plain-language **system description** into
a structured **threat model** for any software system — complete with a
Mermaid **attack-path diagram** and one-click Markdown export.

It runs out of the box in an **offline mock mode** (no API key required) or
against the **OpenAI API** when a key is configured.

---

## Project overview

Threat modeling is often a slow, expert-driven workshop. This tool gives engineers
a fast first draft: describe the system, and the assistant produces a STRIDE-based
threat model covering assets, trust boundaries, threats, attack paths, security
requirements, and test cases. The output is a starting point for human review —
not a replacement for a formal security assessment.

It works for a broad range of systems — web and mobile apps, APIs and
microservices, cloud and on-prem infrastructure, data stores, and IoT/embedded
devices — and applies established practice (STRIDE, OWASP, NIST).

## Features

- 📝 Paste a system description plus optional fields (name, business impact, data
  handled, external interfaces).
- 🤖 One-click generation of a 9-section threat model:
  System Overview · Key Assets · Trust Boundaries · Threats (STRIDE) ·
  Attack Paths · Security Requirements · Security Test Cases · Assumptions ·
  Residual Risks.
- 🔀 **Mermaid attack-path diagram** rendered in-app and embedded in the report.
- 📋 **Load Sample** system to try it instantly.
- 📤 Export: **Download .md** or **Save to `outputs/`**.
- 📥 **Import** a previously exported `.md` report to re-view, re-render its
  diagram, and re-export — the system name is recovered automatically.
- 🧰 **Offline mock mode** — develop and demo with no API key or network.
- 🗂️ Clean, tabbed UI (Input · Generated Threat Model · Export) with a sidebar guide.

## Setup

```bash
cd "MasteringAgenticAI/Week 1/ai-threat-modeling-assistant"

# (recommended) create and activate a virtualenv
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # works as-is in mock mode
```

## Testing

An automated **functional flow test** exercises the whole pipeline offline
(mock LLM, no API key): build prompt → generate → assemble report → **export to
a file → check the file → import that same file back**. Run it after any code
change:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # pytest
pytest                                # runs tests/ (USE_MOCK_LLM forced on)
```

The same suite runs in CI on every push/PR.

## How to run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit prints a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501). Open it, go to the
**Input** tab, click **Load Sample** (or paste your own description), then
**Generate Threat Model**.

## Environment variables

Set these in `.env` (see [.env.example](.env.example)):

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI key. Blank → mock mode. | _(empty)_ |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model used in OpenAI mode. | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `USE_MOCK_LLM` | `true` forces the offline mock regardless of the key. | `true` |

The sidebar shows which mode is active.

## Example use case

> **Customer Web Portal.** A security engineer is reviewing a web app with a
> single-page frontend, a REST API, a database, and a third-party payment
> integration. They paste the architecture, click generate, and immediately get:
> the key assets (credentials, PII, secrets, database), the trust boundaries
> (internet↔frontend, app↔database, service↔third-party), a STRIDE threat table,
> an attack path (stolen token → frontend → API → app server → database)
> visualized as a diagram, plus mapped security requirements and test cases —
> then exports it to Markdown for the design review.

## Future improvements

- Per-threat risk scoring (e.g. CVSS / DREAD) and sortable tables.
- Multiple diagram types (data-flow diagram with trust boundaries, not just attack paths).
- Support for additional providers (Anthropic, Google) behind the same client.
- Persist and compare threat models across revisions of a system.
- Export to PDF/HTML and DOCX in addition to Markdown.
- Library of reusable system templates (web app, API, mobile, IoT, cloud).

## Demo script

A 60-second walkthrough:

1. **Open the app** — `streamlit run app.py`. Point out the sidebar instructions
   and the **LLM mode** badge (mock by default — no key needed).
2. **Load the sample** — Input tab → **Load Sample** fills in the Customer Web
   Portal system. Mention the optional fields that sharpen the result.
3. **Generate** — click **Generate Threat Model**; the spinner runs and a success
   message appears.
4. **Review** — Generated Threat Model tab: scroll through the 9 sections, then
   highlight the **rendered Mermaid attack-path diagram**.
5. **Export** — Export tab: **Download .md** (show the titled, timestamped report)
   or **Save to outputs/**.
6. **Switch to live mode** (optional) — set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
   `USE_MOCK_LLM=false` in `.env`, rerun, and regenerate to show real LLM output.
